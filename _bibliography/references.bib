    abstract = {Heterogeneity in human diseases presents challenges in diagnosis and treatments due to the broad range of manifestations and symptoms. With the rapid development of labelled multi-omic data, integrative machine learning methods have achieved breakthroughs in treatments by redefining these diseases at a more granular level. These approaches often have limitations in scalability, oversimplification, and handling of missing data.In this study, we introduce Multi-Omic Graph Diagnosis (MOGDx), a flexible command line tool for the integration of multi-omic data to perform classification tasks for heterogeneous diseases. MOGDx has a network taxonomy. It fuses patient similarity networks, augments this integrated network with a reduced vector representation of genomic data and performs classification using a graph convolutional network. MOGDx was evaluated on three datasets from the cancer genome atlas for breast invasive carcinoma, kidney cancer, and low grade glioma. MOGDx demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and an ability to identify relevant multi-omic markers in each task. It integrated more genomic measures with greater patient coverage compared to other network integrative methods. Overall, MOGDx is a promising tool for integrating multi-omic data, classifying heterogeneous diseases, and aiding interpretation of genomic marker data.MOGDx source code is available from https://github.com/biomedicalinformaticsgroup/MOGDx.},
